Hi! I'm Jonatas, a postdoctoral scholar at the University of Chicago's [Data Science Institute](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/), where I enjoy building tools and systems to monitor and measure network performance, developing data pipelines to collect and analyze the measured data, and writing papers and reports sharing data-driven insights on Internet access performance and more. I hold a PhD degree in Computer Science from the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS) and spent one year as a visiting research scholar at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. You can learn more about me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonatas-marques/) and read my past publications on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=20R9TQ4AAAAJ).
