Hi! I'm Jonatas, a recently graduated PhD in Computer Science **looking for Postdoctoral Research positions in the Greater Chicago and Urbana-Champaign areas.** I earned my PhD from the [Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS, Brasil)](http://www.ufrgs.br/). My research helps advance network management in the programmable networking era. I was advised by [Prof. Luciano Paschoal Gaspary](https://www.inf.ufrgs.br/~paschoal). During my PhD, I also spent one year as a research scholar at the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/) working with [Prof. Kirill Levchenko](https://klevchen.ece.illinois.edu/).
